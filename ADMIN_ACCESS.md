```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS admins (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  permissions TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY['read', 'write'],
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE admins ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Admins can view their own records" ON admins
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
